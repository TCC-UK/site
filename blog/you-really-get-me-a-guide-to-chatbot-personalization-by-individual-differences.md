As indicated by the numbers in [this post](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/#ca4ef6c2a942), 84% consumers want to be treated as a unique individual not just a number, while 95% of companies saw 3X ROI from their personalization efforts. Now with the rise of [conversational commerce](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/conversational-commerce#:~:text=Conversational%20commerce%20is%20a%20term,WhatsApp%2C%20Talk%2C%20and%20WeChat.), chatbots seem serve as a perfect channel for personalization due to the one-on-one, private nature of conversations. In a conversation, a chatbot can naturally elicit users' needs and wants and then provide personalized help or guidance based on the gathered information. 

However, most personalization has been done in a "shallow" way by using explicit information collected from users, such as user past activities (e.g., purchasing history), and user explicit preferences (e.g., "I want a car under $5000"). While such information helps personalize a chatbot's interaction with a user, it is inadequate in many circumstances. Consider the following real-world examples.

Sam is a new customer to a restaurant and has never ordered anything from the restaurant before. What kind of dishes should the restaurant's chatbot recommend to a new customer like Sam? 

Emma is a user of a wellness app for anger management. Emma is supposed to interact with the app and document her emotional states on a daily basis. How should the app's chatbot encourage Emma to stay on course when Emma wants to give up?

Phil is a senior in college. To prepare for upcoming job interviews, Phil practices interviews with [an interview chatbot](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3232077). What kind of advices the chatbot should give Phil and help him succeed in his job interviews?
