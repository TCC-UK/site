As indicated by the numbers in [this post](https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2020/02/18/50-stats-showing-the-power-of-personalization/#ca4ef6c2a942), 84% consumers want to be treated as a unique individual not just a number, while 95% of companies saw 3X ROI from their personalization efforts. Now with the rise of [conversational commerce](https://www.shopify.com/encyclopedia/conversational-commerce#:~:text=Conversational%20commerce%20is%20a%20term,WhatsApp%2C%20Talk%2C%20and%20WeChat.), chatbots seem serve as a perfect channel for personalization due to the one-on-one, private nature of conversations. In a conversation, a chatbot can naturally elicit users' needs and wants and then provide personalized help or guidance based on the gathered information. 

However, most personalization has been done in a "shallow" way by using explicit information collected from users, such as user past activities (e.g., purchasing history), and user explicit preferences (e.g., "I want a car under $5000"). While such information can help personalize a chatbot's interaction with a user, it is often inadequate in many circumstances. Consider the following real-world examples.

Sam is a new customer to a restaurant and has never ordered anything from the restaurant before. Although Sam explicitly expressed that he prefers fish to red meat, there is still a wide range of selection. What kind of dishes should the restaurant's chatbot recommend to a new customer like Sam? Knowing that Sam is family oriented and enjoys down-to-earth food, the chatbot suggests the family style, home-style fish set menu. 

Emma uses a wellness app for anger management. Emma is supposed to interact with the app and document her emotional states on a daily basis. How should the app's chatbot encourage Emma to stay on course when Emma wants to quit? 

Luna just got her driver's license and wants to buy her first car. Since Luna has never owned a car before, she can provide only a price constraint, e.g., under $15,000. With a number of cars that meet the price constraint, what kind of cars a chatbot on a website like [carmax](https://www.carmax.com/cars) should recommend to Luna ? If the chatbot knows that Luna has keen artistic interests, it would recommend a used but stylish Mini Cooper or VW Beetle.  

Phil is a senior in college. To prepare for his upcoming job interviews, Phil practices interviews with [an interview chatbot](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3232077). What kind of advices the chatbot should give Phil and help him succeed in his job interviews? 

Amy has diabetes and love sweets. How should a chatbot that serves as a personal wellness assistant can help persuade Amy to reduce sweets intake?

All the examples above show that a chatbot would be able to offer suitable suggestions and advices if it knows the [individual differences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_and_Individual_Differences)--the unique characteristics--of its users.
