I spent some time today studying documentations of chatbot offerings of a few major technology vendors: Amazon Lex, Facebook Messenger, Google DialogFlow, IBM Waston, and BotKit recently acquired by Microsoft. My ranking of the above platforms in term of technical capability is the following:

IBM Waston > Microsoft Botkit > Google DialogFlow = Amazon Lex > Facebook Messenger.

My assessment is purely based on the documentations. Since I have not tried any of the listed systems, you need to take my opinion with a giant grain of salt. An additional disclaimer: I am one of the main developers of[Juji](https://juji.io/), a chatbot creation platform, so I will comment on the comparison with Juji wherever appropriate.
