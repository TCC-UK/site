JumpStartÂ® is the leader in creating interactive experiences that enrich, entertain and educate. It produces high-quality educational games that provide positive, safe and fun experiences. Their games have earned the trust of millions of teachers, parents, and respected organizations such as Common Sense Media and The National Parenting Center.

# The Challenge

As online learning has become increasingly more important, the JumpStart team developed and launched a new online service called Activity Studio. This  service enables teachers to create, share, and use fun, game-based learning in their teaching activities. On the other hand, these online learning materials can help improve student engagements and boost students' learning interests. 

Because it is a new service, the team faced several challenges. First, it was time consuming to manually respond to user questions because it did not have a comprehensive user manual or FAQs.  Second, it is unclear why certain users abandoned their activities and there was no easy way to engage with such users during their activities and collect their feedback so their feedback can be used to improve the service. 

# Implementation

To address the two challenges mentioned above, the service team designed and implemented a chatbot with three functions:

1. Anwer user questions about the service

2. Elicit user product input and needs

3. Teach user key service features

# The Outcome
