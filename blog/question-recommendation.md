In an ideal world, the AI Chatbot you build would answer all user questions. However, that's not the case right now. No matter how smart your AI Chatbot it is, there will always be some questions it does not know how to answer. There are mainly two reasons why a chatbot cannot answer a question: 1) the creator did not provide enough information to answer this question, 2) the chatbot fails to understand the question. A potential third reason is that the user has not gave enough information for the chatbot to answer the question, such as an user asks "what's the whether like in my city?" while the chatbot does not know which city the user lives in. The can be solved if the chatbot creator anticipated this potential complication and add a mini flow to handle it. In Juji Studio, this can be easily handled by adding an extended reply to the question in Q&A Board.
