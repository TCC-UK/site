During this difficult time of COVID-19 pandemic, you must be inundated with requests and demands from the general public. As an AI chatbot company based in Silicon Valley, CA,[Juji](https://juji.io)would like to help. We are currently offering our chatbot services free-of-charge to healthcare organizations or medical professionals.



Juji's platform automatically answers user questions in Facebook Messenger or on a website based on a curated list of questions and answers. For example,[a group of volunteers from the New Voices Program](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/post/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-misinformation-about-covid-19)(https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/post/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-misinformation-about-covid-19) of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine have used Juji to create an AI chatbot,[Jennifer](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/jennifer-ai-chatbot)(https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/jennifer-ai-chatbot), to clarify misinformation and answer public questions about COVID-19.



We are offering the same free service to you so that critical health information can reach more people in this time of need. With extended home stays, online media becomes a significant source of information. We can help set up a free chatbot in Facebook Messenger associated with your public Facebook Page or just a chatbot on your website. Setting up a chatbot like Jennifer on our platform is super easy and fast, and requires minimal effort since we will guide you through the process.



Please let us know who the appropriate contact is, so that this new, free automated information channel becomes accessible to the public 24/7. This will help alleviate any manpower shortages while reserving precious human resources for more urgent matters, e.g., coordinating logistics and caring for patients.
