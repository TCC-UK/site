The ability for a chatbot to answer user questions is highly desirable. Previously, I talked about how to create a Q&A chatbot in a few minutes to [answer users' free-text questions](https://juji.io/blog/building-a-smart-chatbot-in-a-few-minutes-to-answer-free-text-questions/) as well as [handle multi-turn Q&A](https://juji.io/blog/how-to-make-your-chatbot-to-answer-non-trivial-questions/), all without coding. Because no chatbot is perfect, I also mentioned how to teach a chatbot better [handle unknown user questions](https://juji.io/blog/question-recommendation/) and improve customer satisfaction.  

Now that you have built a very capable Q&A chatbot, you may want to know how your chatbot performs by getting answers to the following questions:

1. What are the questions the chatbot has answered?
2. What are the questions the chatbot cannot answer?  How many of them?
3. Among the unanswered questions, how frequently do user ask these questions? 
4. How are these unanswered questions related to each other? 

Obviously, answers to the above questions can provide chatbot owners or admins valuable insights to improve a chatbot, e.g., improving a chatbot to answer the unanswered questions.  Unfortunately, few chatbot platforms provide such insights, which makes a chatbot owner/admin unaware of a chatbot's Q&A performance, let alone helps improving its Q&A capabilities.  

To help chatbot owners improve a Q&A chatbot easily and quickly, the Juji platform provides built-in Q&A monitoring facility to inform chatbot owners of their chatbot Q&A performance. 

# Monitor Q&A Chatbot Performance: Monitoring Unanswered User Questions

Specifically, we have built several Q&A chatbot monitoring tools to answer the questions above. Here I'll focus on how Juji helps chatbot owners obtain answers to questions 2-4 and how such insights can help improve a chatbot's Q&A capability quickly.

Ideally, your FAQ list should be as complete as possible. However no one can anticipate all the questions users might ask. Thus, it is useful to know what user questions are ***not*** answered by a chatbot. Juji's Q&A Board does just that. As shown below, the Q&A dashboard provides you with real-time notifications of unanswered user questions as users are interacting with your chatbot. 

![A real-time dashboard displaying a list of user questions that a chatbot cannot answer.](/assets/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-11-at-5.52.19-pm.png "Juji Q&A Board is a real-time dashboard that displays a list of unanswered user questions. ")

The red square icon next to the "Q&A BOARD" tab indicates the number of unanswered questions the chatbot has encountered so far. The number gets updated in real-time. So you, as a chatbot designer, will notice it while working on other parts of the chatbot. In the example above, there are 5 unanswered user questions. Moreover, all the unanswered questions are listed inside the table where you can answer them right away.

Alternatively, you can download all Q&As including the unanswered questions in a CSV file. The CSV file typically lists all the unanswered user questions and their stats at the end of the file. Juji also automatically analyzes all unanswered questions and arranges them in different groups such that the similar ones are listed next to each other. As shown in a sample CSV file below, there are five unanswered questions (rows 38-44), arranged into three groups: rows 38-39, rows 41-42, and row 44. 

Next to each unanswered question, there is also a number indicating how many times (frequency) that question was asked. In the example below, the question "*How do I log in*" (row 38) was asked once, while another similar question "*How do I sign in*" was asked twice (row 39). 

Such information can then be used to easily prioritize the handling of unanswered questions especially if there are a number of unanswered questions.

# Update Chatbot FAQs

Once you know what questions are unanswered, there are two ways to update chatbot FAQs. You can update them directly on the Q&A Board. Alternatively, you can update the CSV file, then upload it to the chatbot.

## Update FAQs on the Q&A Board

If you just have a few unanswered questions, you may want to add their answers right away. To do so, just add your answer in the corresponding text box and submit it using the "Submit" button. In most cases, an answer submission will take an immediate effect--a chatbot can answer the unanswered question *immediately* without the need of restarting. 

![Add an answer to an unanswered question in Q&A Board](/assets/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-13-at-9.04.45-pm-copy.png "Add an answer to an unanswered question in Q&A Board")

As shown above in a screenshot, the Q&A Board also provides several useful tools to help a chatbot owner customize answers:

* The "+" sign in a text box allows you to enter alternative question/answer expressions, while the down arrow button allows you to view and select these varied expressions. Question variations help a chatbot better recognize user questions. On the other hand, answer variations give a chatbot a set of answers to choose from, so its response can appear more natural to users.
* The "â†’A" button on the top right corner of the answer text box lets you search for the answer of a matched question, saving your time to enter an answer from scratch.  This is especially helpful if there is an extensive existing Q&A list.
* The "\[+]" button on the bottom right of the answer text box lets you open up an editor to define or edit a multi-turn answer.  My [previous blog post](https://juji.io/blog/how-to-make-your-chatbot-to-answer-non-trivial-questions/) explained this powerful tool.

Moreover, the Q&A Board allows you to add new Q&A pairs. To add a new pair of Q&A, simply click on the "+" sign at the top of the table. You can then edit the question and answer as described above. You can also edit an existing Q&A pair by clicking on the magnifying glass next to the "+" sign, which allows you to search for and select an existing FAQ to edit .

## Update and upload your FAQ CSV file

Although the Q&A Board makes it very easy to update your FAQs, updating the FAQs inside the CSV file may be more convenient if there is a large number of unanswered questions or if there are multiple people involved in updating the FAQs. 

You can simply upload your CSV after all the editing is done. In case you are not already familiar with how to update the FAQs in a CSV file, you can check out my [previous blog on this](https://juji.io/blog/building-a-smart-chatbot-in-a-few-minutes-to-answer-free-text-questions/).

Creating a chatbot and publishing it is not the end but the beginning of a journey, just like raising a kid, who needs to be taught and nurtured as s/he grows.  Similarly, a chatbot needs to be continuously taught, so it can be improved and become better and better at its tasks. Answering user questions is an important skill for almost all chatbots. That's why Juji Q&A dashboard exists to help chatbot designers and owners monitor their chatbots easily and improve their chatbots quickly.
