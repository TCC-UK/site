Students have difficulty receiving career advice due to the low advisor-to-student ratio. Is it possible to create a chatbot that could act as a career counselor? The implications could be significant, it could reduce the impacted schedules of counselors by augmenting their work and answer student inquiries 24/7. However, understanding whether or how chatbots could act as a career counselor is under studied. 

To gain a better understanding, we designed and conducted a survey using a chatbot made on the [Juji platform](https://juji.io/docs/juji-studio/). The chatbot asked 350 students in a business department at a large university on their thoughts of how chatbots could serve as a counselor. Students were very creative and gave interesting insights on chatbots as career counselors. Below summarizes the students' ideas and their requirements for a career counseling chatbot. 

Students' ideas were summed up into 4 major themes:

1. Offering information and recommendations
2. Providing intervention on career development
3. Augmenting counselors' work
4. Providing career counseling

First, students would like a career counseling bot that can offer information and recommendations. More specifically, they would like to get answers to questions related to the university, such as financial aid deadlines, school holidays, and career advice. They also have high hopes for the chatbot and would like it to recommend career choices based on their conversation with the chatbot. In other words, such a chatbot should be able to capture students' personality and match it with a career best-suited for them.

Next, providing intervention on career development was another theme commonly mentioned by students. Interestingly enough, students wanted varying degrees of intervention in their career development. The first intervention method they suggested was reminders for upcoming career events, such as career fairs or career workshops, like resume building or LinkedIn profile workshops. The next intervention method was goal tracking. Students wanted to be able to set personal goals and deadlines for themselves through conversation with the chatbot and receive reminders on their progress towards those goals, such as receiving an internship. The final intervention method was assistance in career development through mock interviews and resume scanning. Notice that the degree of intervention becomes increasingly involved.

Another major theme was augmenting counselors' work. By this, students meant that the chatbot could act as a medium between advisors and students connecting the two parties together. They suggested the chatbot to be able to redirect users to a human to answer their questions. Another common suggestion was gathering students' concerns before an appointment with the counselor and creating those appointments for them.

The final theme was providing career counseling. In other words, students wanted the chatbot to become the counselor by providing career advice and giving guidance on the necessary courses for graduation. 

The four themes derived from the study can be used to guide the implementation of a chatbot as a career counselor for students. For more detailed information on this study, please refer to our [full paper](https://aisel.aisnet.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1264&context=amcis2019).
