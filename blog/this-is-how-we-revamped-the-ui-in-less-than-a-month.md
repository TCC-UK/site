We all know that user interface (UI) development is an iterative process. It is important that we can iterate quickly based on user feedbacks. At Juji, we have been constantly searching for solutions that enable faster iterations for our Juji Studio product. Around the end of last year, we did a major revamp of Juji Studio UI. By all accounts, this change made a huge difference in term of usability of Juji Studio. More importantly, we can now iterate much faster than previously possible. What's more, we did the wholesale changes in less than one month! Here is how we did it.

One of the main innovations that we came up with is a new way to handle the client-server communication for a single page application (SPA). Instead of sending resource oriented API calls, the client sends the diffs of its data model back to the server, and server applies the diffs to its own copy of the data model. 

For some background, we have long adopted GraphQL as the API language, with which the server side and the Web client speak to each other. GraphQL has been a good choice, as it is fairly flexible and there are a slew of tools to make it convenient to use. As our product grew in features, we started to feel that changes became harder to make, and iterations slowed down to a crawl. 

Juji Studio interfaces with many different stateful systems to enable DIY AI chatbot creation. For example, it needs to work with our chatbot DSL generator to generate the code from the UI, communicate with the chatbot runtime system in order to enable preview of the chatbots, talk to deep learning compute services to get recommended topics, handle long running analytical jobs by using a Kafka cluster, and additionally talk to various databases systems to query and transact information. All these backend work need to be surfaced to the UI in various ways to give user a smooth experience. Not surprisingly, our GraphQL schema file alone grew to be over 2K lines of Clojure EDN code. For a language famous for its conciseness, this is a huge amount of code just for describing the API schema.

We started to question: did we really need this many API calls? Was there a way to cut the number down? Stepped back and examined what we were doing, we decided that this was not sustainable. What we were doing is the standard way of building APIs: viewing the client-server communication as retrieval and manipulation of remote resources. Even with GraphQL, we are still thinking in the REST way, or the CRUD way.  For any resource, one would need at least four API calls,  one to create it, one to query it, one to update it, and one to delete it. However, unlike many CRUD applications that only need a database backend, the GraphQL API of Juji Studio cannot be automatically generated from a database schema because of the diverse systems that it interacts with, so we wrote many repetitive APIs for various different things.  

The worst part was not the number of repetitive APIs, but the scatteredness of business logic. To change anything, we needed to update the database schema, update the backend code, update the API schema, update the service side of the API, then update the client side of the API, and finally, we got to write UI code for the change that a user would actually see. This is a very long chain of events, and things could break down anywhere. Particularly, as it was often the case, these different links of the chain were handled by different developers. With the added communication overhead, it was a miracle that we could get anything changed at all!
