A while back, I wrote a blog on ["Chatbot Tsunami"](https://juji.io/blog/chatbot-tsunami-the-good-bad/), mentioning that our world is inundated with chatbots, including both [good ones](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/post/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-misinformation-about-covid-19) that can help us fulfill our requests and bad ones that can hardly understand or achieve anything.

Since Juji always aims at powering all good chatbots with the smarts needed to help users, I had assumed two things:

* Everyone would know what these smarts are 
* Everyone would know how hard it is to teach chatbots such smarts

Until recently, when I was demoing our [conversational AI (AI chatbot) platform](https://juji.io/juji-platform/) to a customer, I suddenly realized that something I took for granted (the two things listed above) is not common knowledge. 

This was a usual customer meeting during which I showed how to build a chatbot as a personal healthcare assistant that can check in on a user on a daily basis (Figure 1) as well as provide just-in-time help as the user requests it (Figure 2). It took me literally 3 minutes to create the chatbot including adding a few Q&As. I then spent a few minutes to show the chatbot in action (try it yourself if you wish to).  

Because the demo went so well and everything worked flawlessly, I was thinking to myself they ought to be impressed by our work. However, there was a dead silence after my demo. I then asked "do you have any questions about the demo?" One person asked: "I got it. But where is the AI?" 

I was surprised by the question and also disappointed at myself that I failed to demonstrate the smarts of the chatbot -  the hallmark of Juji, something that we believe differentiates Juji from all other chatbot platforms! 



This client's question now reminded me of other comments I heard before. One interested customer read our [documentation](https://juji.io/docs/) on the topic of "[why AI chatbots](https://juji.io/docs/why-ai-chatbots/)" and then called me "by reading your documentation, it seems I don't need an AI chatbot." I then asked him why he wanted a chatbot.  He replied that he just want a chatbot to gather some information from his
