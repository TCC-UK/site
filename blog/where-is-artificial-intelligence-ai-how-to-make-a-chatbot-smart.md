A while back, I wrote a blog on ["Chatbot Tsunami"](https://juji.io/blog/chatbot-tsunami-the-good-bad/), mentioning that our world is inundated with chatbots, including both [good ones](https://www.newvoicesnasem.org/post/using-artificial-intelligence-to-combat-misinformation-about-covid-19) that can help us fulfill our requests and bad ones that can hardly understand or achieve anything.

Since Juji always aims at powering all good chatbots with the smarts needed to help users, I had assumed two things:

* Everyone would know what these smarts are 
* Everyone would know how hard it is to teach chatbots such smarts

Until recently, I realized that something I took for granted (the two things listed above) is not common knowledge. 

Just a few weeks ago, I was demoing our [conversational AI (AI chatbot) platform](https://juji.io/juji-platform/) to a customer. In this demo, I showed how to build a chatbot as a personal healthcare assistant that can check in on a user on a daily basis (Figure 1) as well as provide just-in-time help as the user requests it (Figure 2). It took me literally 3 minutes to create the chatbot. I then spent a few minutes to show the chatbot in action (try it yourself if you wish to).  

![A chat between a chatbot and a user where a chatbot asks how the user is feeling.]( "Figure 1. A screenshot showing a Juji chatbot as a personal healthcare assistant to greet a user daily.")

![A chat between the Juji chatbot and the user when the user interrupts the flow by making a request to see a doctor. ]( "Figure 2. A screenshot showing how the uji chatbot handles a user interruption in the middle of a chat flow, fulfills the userâ€™s request, and then resumes the original flow.")

Because everything worked flawlessly, I was thinking to myself they ought to be impressed by our work. However, there was a dead silence after my demo. I then asked "do you have any questions about the demo?" One person asked: "I got it. But where is the AI?" Coincidently (or not so), in a separate meeting after this demo, another customer commented that "I tried Juji. While it is very easy to use and create a chatbot, I'm not sure where the AI is."  

I was certainly taken aback by the questions and also felt quite disappointed at myself that I failed to demonstrate the smarts of Juji chatbot -  the hallmark of Juji, something that we have worked so hard to differentiate Juji from all other chatbot platforms! 

These two clients' question also reminded me of other comments I received before. Some folks who read our [documentation](https://juji.io/docs/) on the topic of "[why AI chatbots](https://juji.io/docs/why-ai-chatbots/)"  told me "by reading your documentation, it seems I don't need an AI chatbot." I didn't think too much about their comments then, and simply believed that they just need a "dumb bot" for their simple tasks, then why bother to build a smart one? 

Now I realized that all these comments are in fact related -- not everyone is aware of the smarts needed in a chatbot (conversational interface) let alone tell whether a chatbot has any intelligence (AI) in it. I thus feel compelled to use this blog to highlight the types of AI that make a chatbot smart and how to tell if a chatbot has any of such AI.   

# What is Artificial Intelligence (Definition of AI)

Before I outline the type of AI a chatbot should have, I want to briefly mention my definition of AI because I get asked alot on this question and my definition is also directly related to the type of chatbot AI I highlight below.  

Although you could look up the [definition of AI on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) to get a more comprehensive idea, my answer is often pragmatic and short: *AI is any human skills that we intend to teach a machine to have*. 

# Four Smarts (AI) Every Chatbot Should Have

Based on my definition of AI and the purpose of a chatbot to automate human interactions, I use the following diagram to outline the human skills that a chatbot should be taught:

![A diagram shows four core human skills a chatbot should have]( "Four smarts (AI) that every chatbot should have.  Here assumes that a chatbot only interacts with a human user via text messages. ")

As outlined above, a chatbot should have four core **human skills** (smarts) to interact with a human user effectively:

1. **[Natural Language Understanding ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding)(NLU)**. This smart refers to a chatbot's abilities to interpret a user's natural language expressions and understand the user's intent(s). 
2. **[Dialog Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialog_manager)**. Once a chatbot understands the intent of a user, it needs to figure out ***what to do**--*how to best respond to the user and move the conversation forward***.*** For example, it may decide to answer a user's question in the middle of the flow (Figure 2) or to ignore the question for now (Figure 3). Because a user often does ***not*** follow a pre-defined chat flow, this smart often refers to a chatbot's abilities to manage user digressions, keep track of the context of a conversation, and ensure the completion of a dialog (task). 
3. **[Natural Language Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_generation) (NLG)**. After a chatbots decides what to do, the chatbot then composes its response to the user. This smart refers to a chatbot's abilities to compose natural language responses in context. For example, a chatbot may compose different expressions to communicate the same content to different users. 
4. **[Reading between the Lines to Understand Users Deeply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics) (Personal Insights Modeling)**. A good human conversationalist not only can grasp the intent of his/her conversation partner, but s/he can also read between the lines to infer the partner's true needs and wants, as well as the partner's characteristics (e.g., cautious vs. easy going). If a chatbot can obtain such insights about its users, it can then [personalize a conversation with each user](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3232077).  For example, [this chatbot recommends different books](https://www.messenger.com/t/109315067094969) to different users based on the reader DNA inferred for a chat. 

![A chat between a Juji chatbot as an interviewer and a job candidate. The Juji chatbot decided to ignore a job candidate's question during an interview and asked the candidate to ask her question later.]( "Figure 3. Screenshot showing that a Juji chatbot as an interviewer decided to ignore a user's question during an interview")

While NLU is still imperfect and most of chatbots have very limited NLU capabilities (Figure 4), there is much progress made on NLU especially with the recent advances in machine learning. 

![It shows two chatbots that don't understand a user's natural language input. The chatbot on the left asks "What's your name?". The user replied "My name is chatbot". And the chatbot thought the user's name is "My name is chatbot". On the right, the chatbot asks "What's your name?", the user responds "What's yours?". The chatbot thanked the user and moved on (and perhaps thought the user's name is "What's yours". ](/assets/uploads/screen-shot-2020-07-08-at-5.32.26-pm.png "Figure 4. Two chatbots ask for a user's name and both fail to understand the user's input")

For example, Juji chatbots are able to [understand highly diverse and complex natural language expressions](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3313831.3376131) using mixed pattern-based and data-driven machine learning methods.  In contrast to the two chatbots shown in Figure 4, Figure 5 shows a Juji chatbot is able to grasp a user's input correctly.

![]( "Figure 5. A Juji chatbot asks for a user's name and correctly interprets the user's input.")

Similar to NLU, NLG has made great advances as summarized by Professor Kathy McKeown in her recent [ACL 2020 keynote](https://acl2020.org/program/keynotes/). On the other hand, another two smarts ***dialog management*** and ***reading between the lines*** are less understood because fewer people are aware of their importance and there are also greater challenges for chatbots to gain these two smarts.  

Next I will describe more why it is important to have a chatbot possess these two smarts. 

## Managing a conversation flow 

Assume what a chatbot can understand a user's input perfectly. In such a circumstance,  the chatbot still needs to decide how to best respond to the user's input and move a conversation forward gracefully.  Just like a person, a chatbot can carry on a conversation in many different directions depending on a user's input and the goals of a conversation. For example, if a goal of a conversation is to help users no matter what, a chatbot would respond to a user's request any time in their dialog. If a goal of a conversation is to [elicit information from a user](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3381804), a chatbot may ask the user to hold on his/her questions until the interview is finished. 

Because 

asked him why he wanted a chatbot.  He replied that he just want a chatbot to gather some information from his

Now thinking back, I probably should not be surprised by the "Where is the AI" question because
