Have you ever thought, "Building a chatbot seems too technical and beyond my capabilities," or "I don't have the coding abilities necessary to create a chatbot?" Starting something new can be intimidating, but you don't need to be afraid, especially with a user-friendly chatbot builder like, Juji, that doesn't require coding.

On Juji, some really helpful and neat features to get you started are:

1. The built-in messages, such as the welcome and wrap-up greetings.
2. The frequently asked questions (FAQs) feature, under the Q&A Board tab.

The built-in messages vary based on the "AI Helper" template you choose once you add a bot to your dashboard, but the welcome and wrap-up greetings are the same and can be edited by clicking on the dialogue box and making adjustments to the way you would like a conversation to flow between the bot and your audience. The editing is easy and it's just like writing in a comments section online.

On the other hand, the Q&A Board is slightly different. This feature requires csv files (which is shown in the image below), but it's very powerful because it allows your chatbot to answer questions, even if they're worded differently. The formatting of the csv file is the key. First, you should download the csv template generated for you and put in those pressing questions your users might have. In the csv file, there are three parts you fill out:

1. The ID
2. The Question
3. The Answer

First, fill in an ID for the question. The ID can be a short and helpful descriptor for the question just for you to remember the topic of the inquiry. Next, you add the questions and the question variations in subsequent lines. Finally, you add the answer. 

A really cool part of this csv template are the IDs. If you notice in the csv image above, you can have multiple questions connected to one answer because there's one ID! Pretty cool right?

With these two features, you can create a chatbot quickly and effectively to reach your audience in time.
