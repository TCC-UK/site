Gartner predicts that 80% of business applications will have a chatbot by 2021. 

"*Building a chatbot seems quite complicated, I don't really have the time to learn and build one*."

"*I want a chatbot for my business but I don't have the technical skills to build one*." 

"*I cannot code so I probably won't be able to build a chatbot*". 

Learning something new can be intimidating. If you have the above thoughts, this blog may completely change your thinking and leave you with a pleasant surprise.  

This is 2020, thanks to great advances in technologies, you can now use a user-friendly chatbot builder to DIY capable AI chatbots, ***without coding and within minutes.***   

Let me show you how quickly you can DIY your first AI chatbot on Juji to support free-text question and answering (Q&A). 

**Template Selection**. Juji provides a set of chatbot templates. For our purpose, let's choose the blank template that we can easily customize.

**Customize Chatbot Welcome and Wrap-up Messages**. The blank template comes with two conversation topics, one is a "***Welcome***" topic that greets a user at the beginning of a chat, while the "***Wrap-up***" topic wraps up a chat. As shown in the screenshots below, you can easily customize both the welcome and wrap-up messages to suit your audience. If you wish, you can also further [customize the ending options](https://docs.juji.io/design/), e.g., looping back to the beginning of the chat. 

**<Terri: we need two screenshots below, one showing the edits of "Welcome" message and the other showing the edits of "Wrap-up" message">**

**Support Free-Text Q&A**. One of the key functions of an AI chatbot is its abilities to address user natural language inquiries during a chat.  To do so, Juji enables you to provide a list of Q&A in a CSV file. First, you can download the CSV file template from the Q&A dashboard as shown below.

The CSV template contains four columns:  

*ID  
*Question
*Answer
*Comment

First, fill in an ID for the question. The ID can be a short and helpful descriptor for the question just for you to remember the topic of the inquiry. Next, you add the questions and the question variations in subsequent lines. Finally, you add the answer. 

A really cool part of this csv template are the IDs. If you notice in the csv image above, you can have multiple questions connected to one answer because there's one ID! Pretty cool right?

With these two features, you can create a chatbot quickly and effectively to reach your audience in time.
