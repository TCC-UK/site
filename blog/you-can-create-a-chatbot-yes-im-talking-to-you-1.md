Gartner predicts that 80% of business applications will have a chatbot by 2021. 

"*Building a chatbot seems quite complicated, I don't really have the time to learn and build one*."

"*I want a chatbot for my business but I don't have the technical skills to build one*." 

"*I cannot code so I probably won't be able to build a chatbot*". 

Learning something new can be intimidating. If you have the above thoughts, this blog may completely change your thinking and leave you with a pleasant surprise.  

This is 2020, thanks to great advances in technologies, you can now use a user-friendly chatbot builder to DIY capable AI chatbots, ***without coding and within minutes.***   

Let me show you how quickly you can DIY your first AI chatbot on Juji to support free-text question and answering (Q&A). 

**Template Selection**. Juji provides a set of chatbot templates. For our purpose, let's choose the blank template that we can easily customize.

**Customize Chatbot Welcome and Wrap-up Messages**. The blank template comes with two conversation topics, one is a "***Welcome***" topic that greets a user at the beginning of a chat, while the "***Wrap-up***" topic wraps up a chat. As shown in the screenshots below, you can easily customize both the welcome and wrap-up messages to suit your audience. If you wish, you can also further [customize the ending options](https://docs.juji.io/design/), e.g., looping back to the beginning of the chat. 

**<Terri: we need two screenshots below, one showing the edits of "Welcome" message and the other showing the edits of "Wrap-up" message">**

**Support Free-Text Q&A**. One of the key functions of an AI chatbot is its abilities to address user natural language inquiries during a chat.  To do so, Juji enables you to provide a list of Q&A in a CSV file. First, you can download the CSV file template from the Q&A dashboard as shown below.

![On the Q&A Board, you can download the csv file and upload it back up. Then, your chatbot is ready to answer questions!](/assets/uploads/q-aboard.png "Q&A Board")

The CSV template contains four columns:  

*ID*  | *Question* | *Answer* | *Comment*

You can give a meaningful ID to index your Q&A pair and also use it to group alternative question expressions or answer expressions.  Every chatbot template  automatically comes with a default Q&A list, which you can customize. Pay attention to the answers in the CSV ended with "#", indicating a default system answer to be customized. Here is [more information](https://docs.juji.io/design/#customize-qa-and-fallback) on customizing Q&As.

Once you are done with your Q&A list, save and upload the CSV file on the Q&A dashboard. Now you can preview your chatbot and test out the Q&As you just put in. 

Since Juji uses machine learning behind the scene to match a user inquiry with the questions you entered by their semantics,  you will notice the following chatbot behavior. First, even if your questions may not exactly match the ones you entered in the CSV, your chatbot can still answer the questions correctly.  Second, if your chatbot is unsure about a match, it will also recommend possible questions, giving your users a chance to select the matched question as shown below.  

**<Terri: could you add a screenshot showing question recommendation>**

If you are satisfied with your chatbot, you can then [deploy it ](https://docs.juji.io/release/)to meet with your audience, either on your Facebook page or on your website.  

This [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkI9c4iBwl8) recaps what I described above. As you can see, creating an AI chatbot is rather easy and fast, perhaps easier than making PowerPoint slides.
