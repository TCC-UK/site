The widespread use of cell phones and social media has made text-based communication, also known as texting, a mainstream communication method. For example, a[Gallup poll](https://news.gallup.com/poll/179288/new-era-communication-americans.aspx)shows that texting is the dominant communication method for Americans under 50. Popular text messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger and WeChat, all boasted over 1 billion active users monthly.

However, a person can hardly text with multiple parties at the same time, let alone do texting 24/7. That’s where chatbots come to the rescue. A chatbot engages a person in one-on-one text messaging to automate various tasks. For example, Sephora uses a Facebook Messenger chatbot to help users[book an in-store makeover](https://www.facebook.com/sephora/), while Kohl’s uses a chatbot to help customers[locate a store or find deals](https://www.facebook.com/kohls)\[3].
