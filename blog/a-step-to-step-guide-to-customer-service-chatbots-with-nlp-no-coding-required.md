As indicated by [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/05/07/will-2019-be-the-breakout-year-for-conversational-commerce-in-the-u-s/#158b88e24ac9), **76% of customers** use text messaging to contact businesses to make inquiries and get support. Now with the required social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, more and more consumers choose to interact with brands online.

Many businesses now receive hundreds or even thousands of customer inquiries daily. Let's assume that each customer service agent [could handle about 20 calls per day](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/inbound-call-strategy), it would need 10 human agents to field about 200 incoming customer inquiries. On the other hand, short of manpower implies the prolonged customer waiting time and a [Forrester study](https://info.ada.support/hubfs/Ada%20Content%20Assets/Ada_Forrester%20Opportunity%20Snapshot.pdf) shows that **2 out of 3 customers** leave after 2-minute wait time.

To cope with the increasing volume of customer interactions, businesses started to look for solutions to automate customer interactions. One solution is to use a chatbot to help answer repetitive questions, such as "*How to reset my password*", "*What is your refund policy*" and "*Where can I download your mobile apps*". A better chatbot can even handle more complex questions that would require multi-turn interactions, such as "*Can you find an online tutor for me*?" and "*Could you show me how to use your product*?"

# Challenges for Making Customer Service Chatbot

However, setting up a capable chatbot for customer services may be non-trivial since a customer service chatbot must have a set of key capabilities to deliver satisfactory customer services. From our own experiences, we have discovered that a customer service chatbot often fail to fulfill its purpose because one of the following reasons.

**Lack of Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This means that a chatbot does not understand a user's natural language inquiries. This also means that such a chatbot must force users to traverse a tree-based menu and find answers they want by clicking on the displayed choices one by one. This approach never works well even if your business is super simple for two reasons. First, such a tree-based menu can hardly include every answer that customers want to know. Second, customers may not know which path to take or which options to select. 

For example, on an e-learning website, I want to find out which SEO course would be suitable for a beginner like me. It would be hard to insert such an answer in a tree-based menu.  In another example, if I want to know if I can get a free trial, should I traverse the path of "Product" or "Price"? 

It is also worth mentioning that **keyword spotting** is often inadequate either because it cannot distinguish the semantic differences between questions like: "*Can I get a refund*" vs. "*When will I receive my refund*" Like Google search, keyword-based information retrieval often retrieves only a list of information that matches one or more keywords, but cannot provide customers with the answers to their specific questions.  

**Lack of Abilities to Handle Interruptions**. As a customer, you may have experienced such a frustration with an incapable chatbot: you asked for a service and you already went down a path for 5 steps. But you asked a question near the last step. Poof, all you did so far was lost and you had to start over again. That is because such a chatbot does not know how to handle interruptions. Once it is interrupted, it starts a process from scratch again. As you can imagine, how frustrated a customer could be when encountering such a situation! Again,  the [Forrester study](https://info.ada.support/hubfs/Ada%20Content%20Assets/Ada_Forrester%20Opportunity%20Snapshot.pdf) shows that 2 out of 3 customers abandon the brand after just one bad experience. 

**Lack of Abilities to Help Human Agents.** No chatbot is perfect and it cannot answer every customer question. It thus is very important to have the abilities to monitor a chatbot,  know when a chatbot fails, and notify human agents of the failure so they can help address the gap. 

**Lack of Abilities to Setup and Update Services Rapidly**. Some chatbot platforms may support all the three capabilities mentioned above. However, it may take a team of engineers months to set up a customer service chatbot and weeks to update such a chatbot, e.g., updating the chatbot's knowledge base. Moreover, most platforms require AI expertise (e.g., defining intents and entities) or programming experience (e.g., wiring all different intents together) to set up a customer service chatbot with the above capabilities.  With such a long turnaround time and difficulties in the chatbot upkeep, an organization would be deterred to take the steps to consider let alone implement a customer service chatbot. 

# Three Steps to Customer Service Chatbot

To help organizations address the issues mentioned above, we have developed the Juji platform with the following four corresponding criteria in mind:

**Rapid Setup**. The Juji platform is carefully designed and engineered to enable a non-technical professional to set up  a capable customer service chatbot ***rapidly***.  Compared other platforms that may require 3-6 months to set up a customer service chatbot with similar or even less capabilities, Juji enables you to set up a capable chatbot in a couple of hours, ***[no coding required](https://juji.io/blog/building-a-smart-chatbot-in-a-few-minutes-to-answer-free-text-questions/)***.

**Chatbot Quality**. Juji supports a general customer service chatbot template. Each chatbot can handle diverse user situations from two aspects. First, Juji chatbots can handle free-text user inquiries expressed in diverse forms. For example, it can recognize "*When will I get my refund*" and "*How long will take my refund to reach me*" are essentially the same question. 

Second, it can [handle complex customer questions that require multi-turn interactions](https://juji.io/blog/how-to-make-your-chatbot-to-answer-non-trivial-questions/) as well as arbitrary user interruptions occurred anytime during a chat with out losing the conversation context (see the screenshot below).

**Chatbot Robustness**. As mentioned above, no chatbot is perfect. Juji has thus made tremendous effort to enable a robust chatbot -- handling unknown user input gracefully. For example, Juji chatbots can **[automatically recommend similar questions](https://juji.io/blog/how-to-make-your-chatbot-to-answer-non-trivial-questions/)** to handle unknown user questions.  This ability enables a customer service chatbot to perform robustly and helps 

**Chatbot Learnability**. To support a chatbot to learn over time and improve itself rapidly, Juji also facilities human agents do so easily. While other platforms may require weeks to improve a chatbot, Juji **[can enable a human agent to do so in real time](https://juji.io/blog/q-a-dashboard/)**. Specifically, Juji summarizes unanswered user questions and notifies human agents in real time. It allows human agents to enter new knowledge and update a customer service chatbot in real time***, with no coding.*** This ability greatly simplifies the upkeep of a customer service chatbot, reduces the downtime of the chatbot, and enables a chatbot to improve rapidly over a short period of time. 

Third, because of its powerful capabilities, Juji allows you to easily turn a customer service chatbot into a customer advocacy chatbot that it can elicit customer reviews or gather user feedback about relevant products and services in the same chat (see screenshots below)
