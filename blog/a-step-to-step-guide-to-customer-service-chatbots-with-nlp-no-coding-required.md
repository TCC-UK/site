As indicated by [this Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/05/07/will-2019-be-the-breakout-year-for-conversational-commerce-in-the-u-s/#158b88e24ac9), 76% of customers contact businesses via messaging to make inquiries and get support. Now with the required social distancing during the pandemic, more and more people choose to interact with brands online.

Our clients shared with us that it is now a norm for them to get hundreds or even thousands of customer inquiries daily. To cope with the increasing volume of customer interactions, businesses started to look for solutions to automate customer interactions. One solution is to use a chatbot to help answer repetitive questions, such as "How to reset my password", "What is your refund policy" and "Where can I download your mobile apps".

If you decide to set up a customer service chatbot and are evaluating different chatbot platforms, we recommend that you consider four key factors:

* Speed. This is to measure how fast you can set up a capable chatbot to handle diverse customer inquiries. Some platforms may require 3-6 months, while Juji enables you to set up a capable one i[n a couple of hours](https://juji.io/blog/building-a-smart-chatbot-in-a-few-minutes-to-answer-free-text-questions/).
* Quality. This is to measure how good a chatbot is in terms of its abilities to handle diverse user situations. For example, Juji chatbots can handle free-text user inquiries expressed in diverse forms, as well as [handle complex customer questions that require multi-turn interactions](https://juji.io/blog/how-to-make-your-chatbot-to-answer-non-trivial-questions/), such as "can you find an online tutor for me?" and "Could you show me how to use your product?"
* Robustness. This is to measure how well a chatbot can handle unknown user inquiries. No chatbot is perfect. So it is important for a chatbot to be resourceful and find ways to handle exceptions -- such as [recommending similar questions](https://juji.io/blog/question-recommendation/) to handle unknown user questions.
* Learnability. This is to measure how fast and easy a chatbot can learn over time and improve itself. Adopting a chatbot is like raising a child, its knowledge needs to be updated periodically to perform better. You want to use a platform that can help your human agents do so easily. While other platforms may require weeks to improve a chatbot, Juji [can enable a human agent to do so in real time](https://juji.io/blog/q-a-dashboard/).
